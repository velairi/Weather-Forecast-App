# GOAT-Take-Home-Project

<b>What I've Accomplished So Far</b>
- Made API calls to DarkSkyAPI
- 

<b>Assumptions</b>
- I didn't have enough time to ask questions and considering that I did this on the weekend, I wasn't sure if anyone would be available, so I went ahead and made some assumptions. I know that when working on a team it would be much easier to clarify specifications than to make assumptions and waste precious development time, but for this project it was the other way around :).
